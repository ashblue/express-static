A re-usable simple static asset server for Express. Ready to go out of the box.

## Basic Setup

1. `npm install` from terminal
1. Place your files in `public`, must include an index.html file
1. Run `sh run-prod.sh` or `sh run-dev.sh`. Note that prod will limit error logs while dev will print out full details.
